        <p> 
            The U.S. Department of Education adopted the Georgia School Climate Surveys in 2018 as part of resources within the National Center on Safe and Supportive Learning Environments (NCSSLE). The NCSSLE provides information and and technical assistance to states, districts, schools, institutions of higher learning, and communities focused on improving student supports and academic enrichment. The NCSSLE maintains a compendium of valid and reliable surveys, assessments, and scales of school climate that can assist educators in their efforts to identify and assess their conditions for learning. For more information and to access the Georgia School Climate Surveys through NCSSLE, please visit the National Center on Safe and Supportive Learning Environments website.  
         </p>
         <h2>PBIS</h2>
        <p>The Georgia School Climate Surveys were adopted in 2014 by the Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, an entity supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs  The PBIS Technical Center supports schools, districts, and states to develop systems for implementing a multi-tiered approach to social, emotional, and behavior support  Schools that complete the GSCS via PBISApps receive a comprehensive report of their survey results and support for school improvement planning from the PBIS Technical Center. For more information about PBIS and school climate, or to access the surveys via the PBIS Technical Center, please visit the PBISApps website.

        <h2>Georgia's School System</h2>
        <p>
        The Georgia School Climate Surveys have part of Georgia’s statewide school accountability system since they were finalized in 2012. The surveys are administered bi-annually to all elementary, middle, and high school students, school personnel, and parents and families. Data collected via the GSCS is used to calculate a School Climate Star Rating, which serves as an indicator of school progress and a data point for school improvement planning. More information about Georgia’s school climate initiative is available at on the Georgia Department of Education website.
